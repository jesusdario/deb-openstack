# Repo for a debian single-machine OpenStack installer
Hacked Devstack!
I'll try to make of it as out-of-the-box as possible.

Run
```bash
# To install OpenStack Compute module
debstack.sh
# To load CirrOS on the cloud
try.sh
# To load global variables onto bash session
load-var.sh
# To uninstall OpenStack
uninstall.sh
```
